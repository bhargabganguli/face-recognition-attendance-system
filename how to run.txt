YOU NEED TO ACTIVATE "ONESHOT" it is the name of a virtual environment created by me where I have installed all the dependencies
libraries and modules.

SO, open command prompt right the following step by step:

activate oneshot

cd Desktop

cd New folder

spyder


it will open the attendance.py under the folder named "New Folder" where you have the code with main.py also.
Now just ctrl+A in spyder window and run all code.
It will take some time to open a new window for desktop integrated webcam and there those faces will be detected
whose facial images are uploaded in the "images folder" just like obama.jpg, biden.jpg, bhargab.jpg


to quit the camera press "Q"


for more info the directory where I kept the files looks like:

Desktop
|---- New folder 
		|---- Attendance.csv
		|---- attendance.py
		|---- main.py
		|---- Images
			   |---- biden.jpg
			   |---- bhargab.jpg
			   |---- obama.jpg
